# GriMok
A new-ruled Omok

Each player gets turns alternately
In one turn each player can select what to do between following three:
1. Draw a line + Put a stone in the line
2. Put two stones in existing line
3. Put one stone in existing line and skip turn(click the black area at the side)

15*15 is the largest size of playing area(can't draw more line) 

quite unbalanced :(
